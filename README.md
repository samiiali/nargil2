## nargil : A numerical simulation toolset

**nargil** is a set of tools for numerical simulation of PDEs. It is written
in C++ and makes use of PETSc, deal.II, Hypre, Eigen, MTL and a number of other
numerical libraries. For what matters, the name *nargil* is not an acronym,
it simply means coconut in Persian !

### Intro
Although, *nargil* is a program for solving a few well-known PDEs, it is
mainly written in the form of a library, which can be used in other codes.
It highly depends on deal.II, but the hybridized dG method employed hereby
is totally independent of deal.II.

### Current Status
Currently, there is only one type of finite element (HDG element) in the
toolset, along with a few model equations.

I started developing the second version of nargil, after I learned more 
about optimizing the code, and I realized that it is not possible to apply
these optimizations in the framework of the previous version.
